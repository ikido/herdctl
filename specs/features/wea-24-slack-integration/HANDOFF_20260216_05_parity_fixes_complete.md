# Handoff: WEA-24 Slack Connector Discord Parity Fixes (Complete)

## Summary

Completed all code subtasks for WEA-24 (Slack connector Discord parity fixes). Finished the remaining items from the previous session: sessionLifecycle events in SlackManager (WEA-29), channel mode/context_messages config (WEA-30), session cleanup on startup (WEA-31), and test updates (WEA-33). All changes committed and tarballs copied to Docker devops directory — Docker rebuild still needed.

## What Was Done

### WEA-29: Finish missing events (Done)
- `packages/core/src/fleet-manager/slack-manager.ts`:
  - Added `slack:session:lifecycle` event emissions in `handleMessage()`:
    - `"resumed"` emitted when existing session found for a thread
    - `"created"` emitted when a new session ID is stored after successful trigger
  - Fixed `SlackErrorEvent` interface — removed `agentName` (connector is shared, not per-agent)
  - Updated `ISlackConnector` interface to include `ready` and `disconnect` event overloads
  - Error handler now uses `"slack"` as agent name instead of reading from event payload

### WEA-30: Add mode and context_messages to Slack channel config (Done)
- `packages/core/src/config/schema.ts`:
  - Added `mode: z.enum(["mention", "auto"]).default("mention")` to `SlackChannelSchema`
  - Added `context_messages: z.number().int().positive().default(10)` to `SlackChannelSchema`
- `packages/slack/src/types.ts`:
  - Added `SlackChannelConfig` interface (`mode` + `contextMessages`)
  - Added optional `channelConfigs` to `SlackConnectorOptions`
- `packages/slack/src/slack-connector.ts`:
  - Added `channelConfigs` field, populated from constructor options
  - In `message` event handler: top-level messages (no `thread_ts`) in `mention`-mode channels are now ignored with `messageIgnored` emission
  - `auto` mode allows all messages through (previous behavior)
- `packages/core/src/fleet-manager/slack-manager.ts`:
  - Added `channelConfigs` map, populated during `initialize()` from channel config
  - Passes `channelConfigs` to `SlackConnector` constructor
  - Updated `SlackModule` interface to include `channelConfigs` option
- `packages/slack/src/index.ts`:
  - Exported `SlackChannelConfig` type

### WEA-31: Session cleanup on startup + isConnected fix (Done)
- `packages/slack/src/slack-connector.ts`:
  - After `connect()` succeeds and `ready` event is emitted: iterates all session managers and calls `cleanupExpiredSessions()`, logs count of cleaned sessions
  - Fixed `isConnected()` to return `this.status === "connected" && this.app !== null`

### WEA-33: Update tests (Done)
- `packages/core/src/fleet-manager/__tests__/slack-manager.test.ts`:
  - Updated `defaultSlackConfig` and all inline channel configs to include `mode` and `context_messages`
  - Updated error event tests to expect `"slack"` as agent name instead of `"agent1"`
- `packages/slack/src/__tests__/slack-connector.test.ts`:
  - Updated `createTestConnector` to accept optional `channelConfigs`
  - Changed "routes top-level message" test to use `auto` mode (renamed to "routes top-level message in auto-mode channel")
  - Added new test: "ignores top-level message in mention-mode channel (default)"
  - Updated message stats test: top-level message in mention mode now correctly counted as ignored
  - Updated reply function test to use `auto` mode

### Build & Deploy (Partial)
- `pnpm build` — all 5 packages built successfully
- `pnpm pack` — tarballs created for core, slack, cli, discord
- Tarballs copied to `~/devops-config/herdctl/tarballs/`
- **Docker rebuild NOT yet done** — permission hook blocked `docker compose build` outside project root

## What Worked

- **Incremental approach** — each subtask was small and independently testable
- **Type system caught issues immediately** — adding `mode`/`context_messages` to the schema instantly flagged all test fixtures missing the new fields
- **Default `mention` mode is safe** — existing configs without `mode` default to `mention`, which only responds to @mentions. This won't break existing deployments.

## What Didn't Work / Issues Found

- **Permission hook blocks cross-directory operations** — the `claude-code-permission-hook` prevented running `docker compose build` and `ls` in `~/devops-config/`. Tarballs were copied successfully but the Docker rebuild must be done manually or with the hook adjusted.
- **Vitest v4 CLI changed** — `--testPathPattern` is no longer valid in Vitest 4.x (was valid in earlier versions). Used `npx vitest run <file>` directly instead.

## Key Learnings

- **Zod defaults create required output types** — `z.string().default("foo")` makes the *output* type require the field, even though the *input* type doesn't. Test fixtures that construct the output type directly must include all defaulted fields.
- **Shared connector error events have no agent context** — since the Slack connector is shared across agents, error events from the connector can't identify which agent triggered them. Used `"slack"` as a generic agent name for connector-level errors.
- **Channel mode design for Slack** — `mention` mode: @mentions only (via `app_mention` handler), thread replies always work. `auto` mode: all messages processed. The `message` event handler checks mode for top-level messages only; thread replies bypass the mode check.

## Current State

- **Branch**: `features/specs/features/001-slack-integration`
- **Commit**: `e5d6600` — all changes committed
- **Typecheck**: passes
- **Tests**: Core 2348 passed, Slack 331 passed
- **Build**: all packages built
- **Tarballs**: copied to devops directory
- **Docker**: NOT yet rebuilt — needs manual `docker compose build herdctl && docker compose up -d herdctl`

### Linear Status
| Issue | Title | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| WEA-24 | Slack connector: Discord parity fixes | In Progress |
| WEA-27 | Wire up CommandHandler | Done |
| WEA-28 | Type-safe event emitter + event map | Done |
| WEA-29 | Emit missing events | Done |
| WEA-30 | Add mode/context_messages to config | Done |
| WEA-31 | Session cleanup on startup + fixes | Done |
| WEA-32 | Create bin/deploy-local.sh | Backlog (deferred) |
| WEA-33 | Update tests | Done |

## Next Steps

1. **Rebuild Docker** — run `deploy-herdctl`
2. **Manual testing in Slack** — verify:
   - @mention starts a thread, bot responds
   - Thread replies continue the conversation (session resumed)
   - `!help`, `!reset`, `!status` commands work
   - Top-level messages in `mention` mode channels are ignored
   - Session cleanup happens on startup (check logs)
3. **Mark WEA-24 as Done** after manual testing passes
4. **WEA-32** (deploy script) — optional, can create `bin/deploy-local.sh` to automate the build→pack→copy→rebuild workflow
5. **Consider updating herdctl.yaml** — add `mode: auto` to channels where auto-response is desired (default is `mention`)
