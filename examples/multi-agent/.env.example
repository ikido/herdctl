#
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your values.

# This example runs two agents, each with their own Discord bot,
# in the same guild and channel. Users can @mention either bot
# to chat with the respective agent.

# Discord Bot Tokens
# ------------------
# Each agent has its own Discord bot. Create two applications at:
# https://discord.com/developers/applications
#
# For each bot:
# 1. Add a bot to your application
# 2. Enable "Message Content Intent" in bot settings
# 3. Generate an invite URL with permissions: Send Messages, Read Message History, Use Slash Commands
# 4. Invite both bots to your server

# Hurricane Watcher bot token
HURRICANE_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_hurricane_bot_token_here

# Price Checker bot token
PRICE_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_price_bot_token_here

# Shared Guild and Channel
# ------------------------
# Both bots operate in the same guild and channel.
# Get these IDs by enabling Developer Mode in Discord settings.
