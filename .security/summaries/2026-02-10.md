## Executive Summary

Today's audit analyzed 1 commit (371bbb7 - security agent definitions) which contained only infrastructure code with no production security impact. The scanner identified 9 findings (3 High as accepted risks, 2 Medium, 4 Low) consistent with previous audits. One open question (Q1 on webhook authentication) was successfully answered - GitHub webhooks use PAT-based API authentication rather than signature verification.

---

## Action Items

### Immediate (Today)
No immediate action required. All High findings are documented as accepted risks (hostConfigOverride feature).

### This Week
- Monitor npm-audit vulnerabilities via Dependabot
- If implementing incoming webhooks, add X-Hub-Signature-256 verification
- Consider investigating 2-3 additional open questions from CODEBASE-UNDERSTANDING.md

## Self-Improvement Applied

Changes made by security-reviewer subagent:
- **HOT-SPOTS.md**: No changes
- **CODEBASE-UNDERSTANDING.md**: Q1 marked as Answered
- **security-audit.md**: Added periodic hot spot verification guidance (verify 3 critical hot spots on rotation when no changes detected and 5+ days since last audit)

---

## Review Feedback

The review identified 6 gaps in today's audit:
1. Hot spot verification was skipped entirely (should verify periodically even when unchanged)
2. Only one question investigated (7 open questions remain)
3. No exploration of recent merged PRs for new attack surface
4. Scanner findings not re-evaluated
5. No trend analysis across multiple audits
6. Q1 investigation adequate but didn't check DoS vectors in polling logic

**Recommendation:** Future audits should verify 2-3 hot spots on rotation and investigate multiple questions when reviewing low-risk changes.
