# Security Audit State

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-05

This document provides persistent state for security audits, enabling incremental reviews that build on previous work rather than starting fresh each time.

---

## Current Position

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Last full mapping | 2026-02-06 | All 4 areas mapped |
| Last incremental audit | 2026-02-06 | Automated via /security-audit |
| Commits since last audit | 0 | Baseline updated |
| Open findings | 5 | See [FINDINGS-INDEX.md](intel/FINDINGS-INDEX.md) |
| Open questions | 9 | See [CODEBASE-UNDERSTANDING.md](CODEBASE-UNDERSTANDING.md) |

**Status:** Incremental audit complete. Q2 answered, no new findings.

### Finding Breakdown

- Critical: 0
- High: 1 (accepted risk - hostConfigOverride)
- Medium: 3 (2 accepted, 1 tracked via Dependabot)
- Low: 1 (tech debt - shell escaping)

### Question Priorities

- High: 0 (Q2 answered)
- Medium: 8 (Q1, Q4, Q5, Q7, Q8, Q9, Q10, Q11)
- Low: 1 (Q3 - container name characters)

## Coverage Status

Security coverage by area with staleness tracking.

| Area | Last Checked | Commits Since | Status | Notes |
|------|--------------|---------------|--------|-------|
| Attack surface | 2026-02-06 | 0 | Current | 270 lines, 22+ entry points |
| Data flows | 2026-02-06 | 0 | Current | 346 lines, 9 flows traced |
| Security controls | 2026-02-06 | 0 | Current | 241 lines, 12+ controls |
| Threat vectors | 2026-02-06 | 0 | Current | 190 lines, T1-T5 analyzed |
| Hot spots | 2026-02-05 | 0 | Current | Baseline verified |
| Code patterns | 2026-02-05 | 0 | Current | Grep patterns run |

### Staleness Thresholds

- **Current:** <7 days AND <15 commits since last check
- **STALE:** >=7 days OR >=15 commits since last check
- **Not mapped:** Area has never been systematically reviewed

## Active Investigations

Active findings and open questions requiring attention. This table is for session continuity - see linked source files for authoritative details.

| ID | Type | Summary | Priority | Status | Source |
|----|------|---------|----------|--------|--------|
| Q1 | Question | Webhook authentication | Medium | Open | [CODEBASE-UNDERSTANDING.md](CODEBASE-UNDERSTANDING.md) |
| Q4 | Question | Log injection via agent output | Medium | Open | [CODEBASE-UNDERSTANDING.md](CODEBASE-UNDERSTANDING.md) |
| Q5 | Question | Fleet/agent config merge overrides | Medium | Open | [CODEBASE-UNDERSTANDING.md](CODEBASE-UNDERSTANDING.md) |
| Q7 | Question | Docker container user (root?) | Medium | Open | [CODEBASE-UNDERSTANDING.md](CODEBASE-UNDERSTANDING.md) |
| Q8 | Question | SDK wrapper prompt escaping | Medium | Open | [CODEBASE-UNDERSTANDING.md](CODEBASE-UNDERSTANDING.md) |
| #009 | Finding | Incomplete shell escaping | Low | Tech debt | [FINDINGS-INDEX.md](intel/FINDINGS-INDEX.md) |
| Q3 | Question | Container name special chars | Low | Open | [CODEBASE-UNDERSTANDING.md](CODEBASE-UNDERSTANDING.md) |

*For full details, see linked source files. This table is for session continuity, not authoritative data.*

### Priority Queue

Ordered by urgency for next audit session:

1. **MEDIUM:** Q1, Q4, Q5, Q7, Q8 (investigate during normal audit flow)
2. **LOW:** #009 (fix when convenient), Q3 (minor defense-in-depth)

*Note: Q2 (path traversal audit) was completed on 2026-02-06 - all vectors verified safe.*

---

## Accumulated Context

Context that persists across audit sessions, enabling continuity and avoiding repeated analysis.

### Recent Decisions

Decisions made during security reviews. Keep to last 10-15 entries; archive older decisions to CODEBASE-UNDERSTANDING.md.

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-02-05 | Accepted hostConfigOverride as documented risk | Required for advanced Docker configuration at fleet level |
| 2026-02-05 | Added path-safety utility for all state file operations | Defense-in-depth after fixing path traversal vulnerability |
| 2026-02-05 | Identified shell escaping as tech debt, low priority (#009) | Container isolation provides security boundary |
| 2026-02-05 | Confirmed 2 scanner findings as false positives (#003, #004) | Help text mentioning env vars, not actual secrets |

### Known Gaps

Security capabilities not yet implemented or areas needing investigation:

- No secret detection in logs (output could leak sensitive data)
- No rate limiting on triggers (DoS vector for scheduled jobs)
- Webhook signature verification status unknown (Q1)
- ~~Other path traversal vectors not fully audited (Q2)~~ - RESOLVED 2026-02-06
- Container user configuration unknown (Q7)

### Session Continuity

Information for resuming work in future sessions.

- **Last session:** 2026-02-06 - Incremental audit via /security-audit
- **Completed:** Ran scanner, change-analyzer, hot-spot-verifier, question-investigator; Q2 answered
- **Resume from:** Audit complete; no outstanding work
- **Next priority:** Next audit in 7 days or after significant changes

## Update Protocol

This section documents how STATE.md should be maintained. Automated update will be implemented in Phase 7 (/security-audit orchestrator).

### At Audit Start

1. Read STATE.md to understand current position
2. Check `commits_since_audit` in frontmatter - has anything changed?
3. Check `status` - was previous audit incomplete?
4. Load Active Investigations as priority list

### At Audit End

**1. Update YAML frontmatter:**

```yaml
last_updated: 2026-02-10T16:45:12Z
last_audit: 2026-02-10
commits_since_audit: 0
open_findings: [count from FINDINGS-INDEX.md]
open_questions: 8
status: "complete" or "partial" with notes
```

**2. Update Coverage Status table:**

- Set today's date for areas verified this session
- Update "Commits Since" for all areas
- Recalculate staleness indicators based on thresholds

**3. Update Active Investigations:**

- Remove completed items (moved to resolved in source files)
- Add new findings/questions discovered
- Re-prioritize based on findings

**4. Update Accumulated Context:**

- Add new decisions to Recent Decisions table (prune if >15 entries)
- Update Known Gaps if gaps closed or new gaps found
- Set Session Continuity for next session

### Between Audits

When commits occur to the codebase:

1. Increment `commits_since_audit` in frontmatter
2. Increment "Commits Since" for each coverage area
3. Update staleness indicators if thresholds exceeded

*Note: This can be automated via git hooks or CI.*

### Size Limit

Keep STATE.md under 300 lines. If approaching limit:

- Archive old decisions to CODEBASE-UNDERSTANDING.md
- Summarize resolved investigations
- Reference detailed reports instead of inline content
