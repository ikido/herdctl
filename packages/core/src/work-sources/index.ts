 *
 * The WorkSourceManager interface defines the contract between work sources
 * and the scheduler/runner, allowing clean integration without coupling.

/**
 * Common interface for all work source adapters
 *
 * Work sources provide work items from external systems (GitHub, Linear, etc.)
 * and handle the lifecycle of claiming, completing, and releasing work.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const github = new GitHubWorkSourceAdapter({ owner: 'org', repo: 'repo' });
 *
 * // Fetch available work
 * const { items } = await github.fetchAvailableWork({ labels: ['agent-ready'] });
 *
 * // Claim a work item
 * const claim = await github.claimWork(items[0].id);
 * if (claim.success) {
 *   // Do work...
 *   await github.completeWork(items[0].id, { outcome: 'success', summary: 'Fixed the bug' });
 * }
 * ```
