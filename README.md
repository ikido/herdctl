# Herdctl

> Autonomous Agent Fleet Management for Claude Code

**Website**: [herdctl.dev](https://herdctl.dev)
**npm**: [`herdctl`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/herdctl)

## Overview

Herdctl is an open-source platform for running fleets of autonomous AI agents. Each agent has its own identity, schedules, and work sources. Think of it as "Kubernetes for AI agents" - declarative configuration, pluggable integrations, and continuous operation.

## Features

- **Fleet Management**: Run multiple Claude Code agents with a single command
- **Declarative Config**: Define agents, schedules, and permissions in YAML
- **Multiple Triggers**: Interval, cron, webhooks, chat messages
- **Work Sources**: GitHub Issues (MVP), with Jira/Linear planned
- **Live Monitoring**: Web dashboard with real-time streaming
- **Chat Integration**: Discord and Slack connectors (planned)
- **Optional Docker**: Run in containers or natively
