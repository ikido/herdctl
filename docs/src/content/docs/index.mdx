## What is herdctl?

**herdctl** is an open-source platform for running fleets of autonomous AI agents. Each agent has its own identity, schedules, and work sources. Agents can be triggered by time (interval/cron), events (webhooks), or chat messages (Discord).

Think of it as **"Kubernetes for AI agents"** - declarative configuration, multiple runtimes, pluggable integrations.

## Key Features

<Card title="Self-Invoking Agents" icon="rocket">
  Define agents that wake themselves up on schedules or triggers. Coordinate an entire fleet from a single `herdctl start` command.
</Card>

<Card title="Full Claude Code Power" icon="open-book">
  If Claude Code can do it, your herdctl agent can do it. Same tools, same MCP servers, same capabilities. herdctl is a thin orchestration layer, not a sandbox.
</Card>

<Card title="Chat From Anywhere" icon="discord">
  Connect agents to Discord (Slack coming soon). Message your agents from your phone, get responses, and they continue working based on your conversation.
</Card>

<Card title="Session Continuity" icon="forward-slash">
  Every job creates a real Claude SDK session. When an agent finishes, you can `claude --resume` that exact session in your terminal. Pick up where the agent left off with full context intact.
</Card>

<Card title="Docker Security Isolation" icon="seti:lock">
  Run agents in isolated Docker containers with kernel-level network namespaces, resource limits, and domain whitelisting. Protect your system and credentials from malicious prompts or compromised skills.
</Card>

## Why herdctl?

| Traditional Approach | With herdctl |
|---------------------|--------------|
| Manually run Claude for each task | Agents work continuously, autonomously |
| Single agent, single task | Fleet of specialized agents per project |
| No scheduling or triggers | Interval, cron, webhook, and chat triggers |
| No work queue integration | GitHub Issues integration |
| Context lost between sessions | Persistent sessions with resume capability |
