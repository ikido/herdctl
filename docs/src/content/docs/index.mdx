## What is herdctl?

An **open-source platform** for running fleets of autonomous AI agents. Each agent has its own identity, schedules, and work sources. Agents can be triggered by time (interval/cron), events (webhooks), or chat messages (Discord/Slack).

Think of it as **"Kubernetes for AI agents"** - declarative configuration, multiple runtimes, pluggable integrations.

## Key Features

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Fleet Management" icon="rocket">
    Orchestrate multiple Claude Code agents working together across your projects. Monitor status, track jobs, and manage the entire fleet from a single dashboard.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Declarative Config" icon="setting">
    Define your agents, schedules, and work sources in simple YAML. Version control your entire fleet configuration alongside your code.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Multiple Triggers" icon="random">
    Trigger agents with intervals ("every 5 minutes"), cron schedules ("9am weekdays"), webhooks, or chat messages from Discord/Slack.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Pluggable Work Sources" icon="list-format">
    Connect agents to GitHub Issues, Jira, Linear, or custom work queues. Agents automatically discover, claim, and complete tasks.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Core Concepts

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Agent" icon="seti:robot">
    A configured Claude instance with identity (CLAUDE.md), workspace (repo clone), and permissions. Each agent can have multiple schedules.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Schedule" icon="seti:clock">
    Defines when and how to invoke an agent. Combines a trigger (interval, cron, webhook, chat) with a prompt template.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Job" icon="seti:todo">
    A single execution of an agent. Has unique ID, tracks status (running/completed/failed), stores session ID for resume capability.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Workspace" icon="seti:folder">
    The directory where an agent operates - a dedicated clone separate from your working copy, keeping agent changes isolated.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Why herdctl?

| Traditional Approach | With herdctl |
|---------------------|--------------|
| Manually run Claude for each task | Agents work continuously, autonomously |
| Single agent, single task | Fleet of specialized agents per project |
| No scheduling or triggers | Interval, cron, webhook, and chat triggers |
| No work queue integration | GitHub Issues, Jira, Linear integration |
| Context lost between sessions | Persistent sessions with resume capability |

## Example Configuration

```yaml
# herdctl.yaml
version: 1

workspace:
  root: ~/herdctl-workspace
  auto_clone: true

agents:
  - path: ./agents/coder.yaml
  - path: ./agents/marketer.yaml
```

```yaml
# agents/coder.yaml
name: bragdoc-coder
description: "Implements features and fixes bugs"

workspace: bragdoc-ai
repo: edspencer/bragdoc-ai

work_source:
  type: github
  filter:
    labels:
      any: ["ready", "bug", "feature"]

schedules:
  - name: issue-check
    trigger:
      type: interval
      every: 5m
    prompt: |
      Check for ready issues and implement the oldest one.
```
