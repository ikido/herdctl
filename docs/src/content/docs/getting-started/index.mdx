## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need:

- **Node.js 18+** - herdctl is built on Node.js
- **Claude Code CLI** - Agents use Claude Code under the hood
- **Git** - For workspace management and repo cloning

## Quick Preview

Here's a taste of what running herdctl looks like:

```bash
# Install herdctl
npm install -g herdctl

# Initialize a new project
herdctl init

# Start your fleet
herdctl start
```

And a simple agent configuration:

```yaml
# agents/my-agent.yaml
name: my-first-agent
description: "My first autonomous agent"

workspace: my-project
repo: username/my-project

schedules:
  - name: check-issues
    trigger:
      type: interval
      every: 10m
    prompt: |
      Check for open issues and report status.
```
