## What is herdctl?

**herdctl** is an open-source platform for running fleets of autonomous AI agents. Each agent has its own identity, schedules, and work sources. Agents can be triggered by time (interval/cron), events (webhooks), or chat messages (Discord).

Think of it as **"Kubernetes for AI agents"** - declarative configuration, multiple runtimes, pluggable integrations.

## Key Features

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Fleet Management" icon="rocket">
    Orchestrate multiple Claude Code agents working together across your projects. Monitor status, track jobs, and manage the entire fleet from a single dashboard.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Declarative Config" icon="setting">
    Define your agents, schedules, and work sources in simple YAML. Version control your entire fleet configuration alongside your code.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Multiple Triggers" icon="random">
    Trigger agents with intervals ("every 5 minutes"), cron schedules ("9am weekdays"), webhooks, or chat messages from Discord/Slack.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Pluggable Work Sources" icon="list-format">
    Connect agents to GitHub Issues. Agents automatically discover, claim, and complete tasks from your issue tracker.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Why herdctl?

| Traditional Approach | With herdctl |
|---------------------|--------------|
| Manually run Claude for each task | Agents work continuously, autonomously |
| Single agent, single task | Fleet of specialized agents per project |
| No scheduling or triggers | Interval, cron, webhook, and chat triggers |
| No work queue integration | GitHub Issues integration |
| Context lost between sessions | Persistent sessions with resume capability |
