Progress: [███████░░░] 75%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 7
- Average duration: 4 min
- Total execution time: 28 min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-state-infrastructure | 1 | 4 min | 4 min |
| 02-mapper-agent-definitions | 2 | 7 min | 3.5 min |
| 03-mapping-orchestrator | 1 | 6 min | 6 min |
| 04-hot-spot-verifier | 1 | 3 min | 3 min |
| 05-question-investigator | 1 | 3 min | 3 min |
| 06-change-analyzer | 1 | 5 min | 5 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 03-01 (6 min), 04-01 (3 min), 05-01 (3 min), 06-01 (5 min)
- Trend: Stable (agent definitions averaging 3-5 min)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Skip /security-deep-dive for v1 (focus on daily workflow first)
- Keep existing scan.ts (works well, no need to rewrite)
- Agents in .claude/agents/security/ (keep with other agent definitions)
- Dedicated branch for daily commits (isolate automated commits from main work)
- 7 agents total (4 mappers + 3 investigators)
- YAML frontmatter for machine-parseable audit state (01-01)
- Reference-not-duplicate pattern for cross-document linking (01-01)
- Staleness thresholds: 7 days or 15 commits (01-01)
- T1-T5 threat taxonomy for herdctl-specific threats (02-02)
- Coverage AND gaps pattern for security control documentation (02-02)
- Residual risk rating (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW) with reasoning required (02-02)
- Follow GSD /gsd:map-codebase pattern for orchestrator structure (03-01)
- All-or-nothing verification: don't commit partial mapping (03-01)
- Investigator agent pattern: return results to orchestrator (not write docs) (04-01)
- Brief on passes, detailed on failures for verification reports (04-01)
- Distinguish accepted risks (WARN) from new findings (FAIL) (04-01)
- 4 question types (existence, scope, behavior, handling) for investigation (05-01)
- Evidence required for all findings including 'not found' answers (05-01)
- Distinguish verified safe from not found for different confidence levels (05-01)
- 5-category change classification: Hot Spot, Entry Point, Pattern, Adjacent, Non-Security (06-01)
- Filter non-production first (docs, tests, tooling get summary count only) (06-01)
- First-match-wins for category ordering (06-01)
